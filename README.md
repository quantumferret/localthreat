## About

**[localthreat](https://next.localthreat.xyz/)** is an online tool to help EVE players with threat assessment.

## Contribution

I do my best to keep the service running at the lowest cost possible, but it still has some. Namely the domain renewal and a \$10 virtual machine on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). Help me help you by contributing to the upkeep of localthreat. [Donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=B9KBZJP99YAE8&source=url).

## Development

### Overview

All the code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/haggen/localthreat). The design lives on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BPH2xeVvbBDAnWpjMI58GpnW/localthreat.next). Bug tracking, feature request, or any other feedback must be made on the [repository's issues page](https://github.com/haggen/localthreat/issues/new).

### Easily

If you've got docker-compose 1.13.0+ installed, simply run:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

This will boot everything you need in one go. You can customize the runtime by editting the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Manually

You'll need Go 1.11.1+ installed. Hop into the `api/` sub-directory and run:

```shell
$ go get
```

To download all the dependencies and then:

```shell
$ make test
$ make
```

To test and build the binary, respectively.

For persistence you'll need PostgreSQL 9.1+ running. Load the `migrate.sql` file into your database and run:

```shell
$ DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost/postgres ./localthreat
```

To start the API server.

### Client

You'll need Node 8.10+ and yarn installed. Hop into the `client/` sub-directory and run:

```shell
$ yarn install
```

To download all the dependencies. Then run:

```shell
$ yarn start
```

To start a development server.
